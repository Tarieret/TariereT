Hi there! I'm TariereðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data enthusiast and a Master's student, always curious about how data can tell stories and help solve problems. With a background in Political Science and Data Science, I enjoy exploring how data-driven insights can be applied across various fields, including the social sciences. When I'm not working on a project, you'll find me reading a good book, painting, or enjoying quality time with friends. âœ¨
