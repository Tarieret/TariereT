# Hi there! I'm Tariere ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Data Science and AI/ML enthusiast, passionate about turning data into insights and building impactful solutions. I enjoy exploring how data-driven approaches can solve real-world problems.

When I'm not coding or analyzing data, you'll find me reading, painting, or spending quality time with friends. âœ¨
